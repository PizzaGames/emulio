# emulio
Emulators frontend inspired by EmulationStation but written in a better platform to support better usability and eye candy.

This reimplementation of the same as emulationstation is done to achieve a much better performance in the usability and a much better way to configure all the settings.

EmulationStation project is great but the PC version is abandonned and since is written in C++ the maintenance can be cruel/brutal. So I decided to create the emulio project. That is written in a much easier programming language and using modern components such as libgdx and kotlin to have a better maintenance and possibly future developers to help me in the development

Initially this is focused on Windows, Linux and MAC platforms, but in the long term the idea is to be totally crossplatform. LibGDX are going to be the limit, that means, what LibGDX supports, we will try to keep this supported as well


## Backlog/Current status
You can see what's planned and in development in the waffle.io boards :)
