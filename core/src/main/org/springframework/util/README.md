# org.springframework.util package

This package is here because we had the dependency to the PropertyPlaceholderHelper from spring
but since we don't need anything else from spring, we've decided to put this class directly here
with its companion classes.

In the mid/longterm we can implement our own PropertyPlaceholderHelper inspired on this one from 
spring so we don't have this dependency here.

Since this project is GPL3 and spring has a license that is open enough for us to use this code, 
it doesn't contaminate anything else on the rest of our code.
 
(please feel free to correct us if we are wrong here.)
