# Notice

All the contets located here are used to perform the initial setup of emulio.

The main idea here is to provide extensibility to user change anything he wants to customize themes, sounds and anuthing else.

On the initial startup, emulio detects that is its first time running, and explodes every file contained here in this folder, to initialize all the necessary files to startup.

## Files

Below a short description about all the files contained here.

- ```simple-theme.zip```
Contains a minimalistic, yet simple and easy theme to be customizable. this is the same simple theme found in the EmulationStation theme. this is extracted on the very first time a user try to open emulio.
- ```emulio-platforms-template.yaml```
Contains a simple template file to be used so the user can change it to contain all the emulators/roms locations and anything else related to the games to be found.
