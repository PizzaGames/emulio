          <desc>Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is played on four stacked 4x4 grids. Players alternate turns placing an &#39;X&#39; or &#39;O&#39; and must align 4 of their own symbols in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to win, similar to Milton Bradley&#39;s board game Qubic. The game features simple graphics with white grids on a bright blue background. The game can be played either against a human opponent or AI which features 8 different skill levels; however, the AI can take a very long time to make a move on high difficulty levels, in late-game states.</desc>

          <desc>Prepare yourself for a spirited game of Miniature Golf ... without ever leaving your house. Test your skills of perception and timing in this electronic version of the pastoral sport. Miniature Golf even has moving obstacles, just like the real thing. Play against a friend or try to beat your lowest stroke count on your own.&#xA;&#xA;There are nine holes to be played in Miniature Golf. Each time you hit the ball, one stroke is added to your score. You may take as many strokes as you need to hit the ball into the cup, but try to aim for par, which represents the number to strokes you are ideally supposed to take to complete the hole.</desc>

          <desc>Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.&#xA;&#xA;Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</desc>

          <desc>This isn&#39;t kid stuff! It&#39;s the fastest, flyingest, most unforgiving trio of events any biker could ask for. Start with a Half Pipe that takes you so high you won&#39;t know whether you&#39;re coming or going. Then do a Quarter Pipe that makes doing dozens of tricks easy and crashing even easier.

          <desc>Beat &#39;Em &amp; Eat &#39;Em is an &#34;adult&#34; electronic video game based upon an ancient ritual&#xA;that has been passed down from generation-to-generation as part of the culture&#39;s oral&#xA;tradition.&#xA;&#xA;The object of the game is to eat &#39;em every time he beats &#39;em. You score one point for&#xA;each and every drop you swallow without a miss. But should you miss, shame on you. You lose one turn. After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.&#xA;&#xA;You have four turns at the outset of the game. Small squares in the lower left-hand&#xA;corner of the screen indicate the remaining number of turns at any point in the game.&#xA;&#xA;You can earn &#34;bonus turns&#34; for every &#34;69&#34; points you score; however, you may&#xA;accumulate no more than 6 turns plus the one in play at any given time.</desc>

          <desc>Two chickens are laying eggs. You&#39;ll know one&#39;s about to drop when a chicken stands up. As they drop down the chutes, Farmer Big Bird moves back and forth to catch them. Different chute patterns make the game more difficult. This kids game is based on the classic Sesame Street character. It is intended for use with the kids controller, which is an oversized keyboard controller into which you insert the included overlay for this game. If you don&#39;t have a kids controller, the keyboard controller works fine, but you&#39;ll have to figure out what the buttons do</desc>

          <desc>Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name. You can play alone or with up to 2 other players against the computer that takes the role of the dealer.&#xA;&#xA;The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player starts the game with 200 chips and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch. He will then start with 200 chips.</desc>

          <desc>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of &#34;Fast run time&#34; (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who&#39;s chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game&#39;s catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</desc>

          <desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a &#34;knockout&#34;) or two minutes have elapsed (a &#34;decision&#34;). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.&#xA;While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the &#34;ropes&#34; and &#34;juggling&#34; him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

          <desc>In Brain Games one or two players attempt to earn as many points as possible by solving various puzzles presented by the computer. There are six different puzzles included, which are:&#xA;•Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.&#xA;•Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.&#xA;•Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.&#xA;•Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.&#xA;•Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.&#xA;•Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also&#34;bump&#34; any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.&#xA;&#xA;Bachelorette Party is an &#34;x-rated&#34; version of Breakout. Move the Spanish fly so that the woman comes in contact with it. She will then ricochet toward the men and &#34;score&#34; with each one she touches. She will then bounce back toward the fly. If you miss her, you lose a turn. The fun part is watching the men&#39;s willies go up and down as she flies toward them. The roles of the men and women are switched in Bachelor Party.</desc>

          <desc>CANYON BOMBER GAMES&#xA;&#xA;GAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)&#xA;Test your skill against the computer.  It&#39;s not an easy task.  You&#39;ve got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks &#34;fall&#34; to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.&#xA;&#xA;Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a &#34;miss indicator&#34; and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.&#xA;&#xA;Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it&#39;s an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)&#xA;This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. &#xA;&#xA;Don&#39;t forget to keep an eye on your opponent&#39;s &#34;miss indicator&#34; as well as your own.  Bombs away!&#xA;&#xA;GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)&#xA;This one&#39;s the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay &#34;suspended&#34; in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)&#xA;You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)&#xA;Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.&#xA;&#xA;No &#34;miss indicator&#34; will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)&#xA;This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;SEA BOMBER GAMES&#xA;&#xA;GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)&#xA;You&#39;re playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you&#39;re ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer&#39;s a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you&#39;re a winner!&#xA;&#xA;GAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)&#xA;This time you&#39;re competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.</desc>

Here’s a brief rundown on each player, just so you’ll know who you’re up against.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;CRASH&#34; MORGAN, the galloping goalie, is the fastest man on the team. &#34;CRASH&#34; got his nickname because he is forever slamming into the goal posts chasing after the ball. Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears stop ringing.&#xA;&#xA;NICK DANGER, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, &#34;eat leather, chump.&#34; Don’t let his bad manners bother you, it’s just his way of rattling the opposition.&#xA;&#xA;&#34;LUMPY&#34; DURAN, the left back, is without a doubt the clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown out of one game for toe-kicking the referee!&#xA;&#xA;ALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI (Putsy), the right back. What can we say about Putsy? A real ladies man, a great soccer player, a sore loser. Even though &#34;The Puts&#34; has kicked and gouged his way to soccer stardom, for three years in a row he has been voted the &#34;least likely&#34; player.</desc>

          <desc>In the 80&#39;s, the popular commercial for Purina dog food included a dog chasing a tiny chuckwagon across the kitchen floor. Inspired by this, Chase the Chuckwagon was produced by Spectravision and released as a promotional item from the Ralston Purina Company. Buy lots of dog food and you could own this. The simple rarity of this game combined with its historical coolness makes it one of the &#34;holy grail&#34; games. The object is to navigate the dog through a maze in an effort to reach the chuckwagon, while avoiding the dog catcher and other obstacles. If he makes it, an animation shows the dog chasing after the chuckwagon and stopping to eat the dog food that falls out of it.</desc>

This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.&#xA;&#xA;There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.&#xA;&#xA;If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</desc>

          <desc>Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of red, blue and white balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

          <desc>Combat 2 is video game for the Atari 2600. Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari&#39;s Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.&#xA;&#xA;Environments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.&#xA;&#xA;The game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.&#xA;&#xA;The game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the &#34;Games That Weren&#39;t&#34; section.</desc>

Each paratrooper allowed to land on a building destroys a portion of that building. If three paratroopers land on a building. It will be totally destroyed and must be considered under commando control.&#xA;&#xA;Worse still, the androids can now tunnel towards your gun emplacement. Each paratrooper who lands on that building expands the tunnel. If they are not stopped, they will plant an explosive charge under the gun.&#xA;&#xA;In the midst of the battle, an aircraft may appear. It will drop a devastating bomb which can destroy all buildings and the gun emplacement. You must shoot it down or at least shoot the bomb it drops. If you miss, its back to basic training!</desc>

          <desc>Civilization is doomed! You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!&#xA;&#xA;The first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more&#xA;&#xA;The second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet&#39;s orbit decays a little more.&#xA;&#xA;If the planet&#39;s orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</desc>

          <desc>Crash Dive is a Defender-esque game in which you fly across the screen shooting stuff.

          <desc>As a professional ornithologist, you&#39;re thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your &#34;old yolk tree.&#34; But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.&#xA;&#xA;Horrified, you get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site. But watch out, egg-stealing creatures are everywhere!</desc>

Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

Your weapon: a high-power laser gun as powerful as that of the enemy.  Your advantage: you&#39;re sharp enough to duck when they shoot.  It&#39;s a hectic chase.  Hop an elevator.

          <name>Desert Falcon (PAL)</name>
          <desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh&#39;s great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn&#39;t completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

          <desc>Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin&#39;s sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...&#xA;&#xA;You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:&#xA;&#xA;THE SEAGULL:  &#xA;Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You&#39;ll know he&#39;s coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.&#xA;&#xA;THE SLIP:  &#xA;Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him &#34;the slip&#34;.  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin&#39;s direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid&#39;s good wave remains on the screen, he won&#39;t be able to reverse and catch you.&#xA;&#xA;SCORING:  &#xA;Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.&#xA;&#xA;Also, you&#39;ll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you&#39;ll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</desc>

The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants.

This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn&#39;t in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

          <desc>TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a power plant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.&#xA;&#xA;The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.&#xA;&#xA;During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.&#xA;&#xA;Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  &#xA;&#xA;To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</desc>

Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.&#xA;&#xA;You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points</desc>

The farmer must hit the gopher to send him back underground or fill in the holes to prevent him from reaching the surface. If gopher has taken any of the three carrots, a pelican will occasionally fly overhead and drop a seed which, if the farmer catches it, he can plant it in the place of the missing carrot. The longer the game, the faster the gopher gets. The game ends when the gopher successfully removes all three carrots. There are two skill levels and is for one or two players, giving a total of four game variations.</desc>

          <desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

          <desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you&#39;ll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don&#39;t blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

As if that weren&#39;t enough... it&#39;s got to be a&#xA;shoot-out all the way.  You alone in your rapid-firing spaceship, swirling&#xA;in a circular flight pattern... orbiting to the right... arcing to the&#xA;left... trying to mow down wave after wave of enemy plane formations,&#xA;rocketing meteors and runaway satellites.  Stops at Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter&#xA;and Mars will mark your progression towards Earth.  Each one&#39;s a short&#xA;visit, though.  Then it&#39;s off again to the next planet - and the next wave&#xA;of enemies.  Reach Earth in one piece and maybe you&#39;ll think twice about&#xA;leaving home.  Then again... maybe not!</desc>

          <desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you&#39;ll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don&#39;t blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

This game requires the use of the Kid&#39;s Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.&#xA;A version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid&#39;s Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.</desc>

          <desc>Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 are one-player games. You compete against the computer. You score one point for every Hangman Word you complete; the computer scores one point for each Hangman Word you can&#39;t complete.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 1:&#xA;One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through third grade vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 2:&#xA;One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 3:&#xA;Playing with words from a first through ninth grade level, one player competes against the computer.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 4:&#xA;Words from a first through high school vocabulary are used for competition between one player and the computer.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Games 5, 6, 7 and 8 are two-player games against the computer. After you select the game vocabulary you want to use, you and your opponent take turns selecting alphabet letters to find the word generated by the computer. Both players together are allowed 11 incorrect selections. When you make a correct letter guess, you receive a consecutive turn. The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 5:&#xA;Two players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 6:&#xA;Two players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 7:&#xA;Words from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.&#xA;&#xA;GAME 8:&#xA;Two players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;GAME 9:&#xA;Now it&#39;s your turn to choose the Hangman Word. Instead of playing with a computer word, one player composes the Hangman Word with the Joystick Controller; the opposing player receives eleven guesses to complete the Hangman Word.&#xA;&#xA;To enter your own Hangman Word into the computer, cycle through the alphabet letters on the screen while your opponent avoids looking at the screen. The Hangman Word may be between one and six letters.</desc>

          <desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.&#xA;&#xA;The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

          <desc>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</desc>

          <desc>You are a secret agent on a mission of crucial importance.  Your mission is to infiltrate a top secret fortress.  You must capture enemy documents and get out alive.  Your challenge: the diabolical maze of corridors and elevators designed to confuse you and keep you from the documents.  Your danger: enemy assassins programmed to shoot on sight.  Your weapon: a high-power laser gun as powerful as that of the enemy.  Your advantage: you&#39;re sharp enough to duck when they shoot.  It&#39;s a hectic chase.  Hop an elevator.  Survive enemy fire.  Fire back. Duck.  Infiltrate...if you dare!</desc>

          <desc>Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one player game, your goal is to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash &#39;n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer. In tag, one player is &#34;it&#34; and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash &#39;n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

          <desc>James Bond 007 is a 1983 side-scrolling video game developed and published by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, ColecoVision and distributed in Japan by Tsukuda Original for the Sega SG-1000. It is the first video game to be based on the James Bond film series.&#xA;&#xA;Players control British spy James Bond in his multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.&#xA;&#xA;There are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, &#34;Good luck, Mr. Bond.&#34; Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.&#xA;&#xA;When a player&#39;s last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of the game, the player also received a double-0 rating based on the difficulty of play (novice or agent), and how well the player did. If played at the novice difficulty, the maximum rating was 005, at agent difficulty, the maximum rating was 007.</desc>

          <desc>You&#39;re on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won&#39;t lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn&#39;t make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

          <name>Killer Satellites</name>
          <desc>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.&#xA;&#xA;You fly above your town&#39;s forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town&#39;s shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town&#39;s forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town&#39;s shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>

          <name>Laser Blast - Duell im Weltall (PAL)</name>
          <desc>The object of Laser Blast is to destroy a series of land-based enemies. The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player&#39;s saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player&#39;s saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player&#39;s saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.&#xA;Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.&#xA;Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.</desc>

          <desc>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you &#39;busted.&#39; There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:&#xA;&#xA;Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].&#xA;Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or&#xA;Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.</desc>

          <desc>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</desc>

          <name>MegaMania - A Space Nightmare - Ein Alptraum im Weltall (PAL)</name>
          <desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player&#39;s spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.&#xA;Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega&#39;s 1981 arcade title &#34;Astro Blaster&#34;. Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an &#34;Energy&#34; meter. Also, the player&#39;s ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.&#xA;&#xA;When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]&#xA;If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

          <desc>In Maze Craze, your goal is to be the first of two players to make it out of a maze! Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</desc>

And more times than not, that’s exactly what he does.  Because he’s tough, clever – resourceful.  And sometimes, downright pig-headed!

          <desc>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you&#39;ve earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.</desc>

Counter-missiles explode upon reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a missile battery becomes useless when all its missiles are fired, or if the battery is destroyed by enemy fire. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.</desc>

Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.</desc>

You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to fall (be careful, you&#39;ll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you&#39;ll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</desc>

          <desc>Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods! They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to fall (be careful, you&#39;ll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you&#39;ll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</desc>

Here we find the last outpost of resistance against the legions of Julius Caesar. And who are the leaders of these indomitable fighters against the mighty Roman empire? Who has the gall to oppose Caesar&#39;s will? Why, none other than a humble menhir deliveryman named Obelix, and his small but shrewd friend, Asterix.</desc>

          <desc>Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.</desc>

          <desc>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their &#34;energy base&#34; at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.&#xA;&#xA;The game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there&#39;s practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it&#39;s an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player&#39;s base and no obstacles to stop them.</desc>

          <name>Pigs in Space - Starring Miss Piggy</name>
          <desc>Prior to starting, players can choose which of the three mini-games they would like to play by selecting the icon for Captain Link, First Officer Piggy, or Dr. Strangepork. Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points.&#xA;&#xA;Captain Link&#39;s level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo&#39;s spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.&#xA;&#xA;First Officer Piggy&#39;s level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. &#xA;&#xA;The final level is Dr. Strangepork&#39;s, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek&#39;s boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.</desc>

Well, you not only have to learn the fine art of baking cakes, but you also have to master it in a big hurry.  This is a production operation, and business is booming!  It&#39;s actually a very simple job--at first.  You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt.  Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors.  You must stack them correctly however, or--splat!!  As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep cool, and try not to earn the dubious title of &#34;butterfingers.&#34;  Being a top notch bakery chef requires adeptness and a calm temperament, so if you can&#39;t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!</desc>

Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? &#34;Yes,&#34; I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? &#34;Yes. Yes. Yes.

          <desc>In Plaque Attack, your goal is to protect a mouthful of teeth from a variety of incoming foods! You control a tube of fluoride toothpaste, and you need to shoot the attacking foods before they can decay the teeth located at the top and bottom of the screen. Hamburgers, hot dogs, gum drops, strawberries, donuts, ice cream cones and more will all appear from the sides of the screen and make their way towards the teeth. If a food item reaches a tooth and is allowed to remain there for too long, the tooth will decay and disappear. The game ends when all of the teeth have decayed and disappeared.</desc>

          <desc>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.&#xA;&#xA;You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don&#39;t delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning, but more difficult this time!</desc>

YOU&#39;RE OUT!&#34; Down on the field it&#39;s a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.&#xA;&#xA;The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher&#39;s glove at 90 miles an hour.  &#34;STEERIKE!&#34;  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and &#34;STEERIKE TWO!&#34;  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!</desc>

          <desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team&#39;s goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense&#39;s goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.</desc>

          <desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.&#xA;&#xA;You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.&#xA;&#xA;Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can&#39;t kill monsters so you can&#39;t replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won&#39;t go long if you run out of energy.</desc>

          <desc>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute, and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don&#39;t wait too long or your chute won&#39;t open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>

          <desc>Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.&#xA;&#xA;As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.&#xA;&#xA;Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don&#39;t believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.&#xA;&#xA;To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</desc>

Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors.

          <name>Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space</name>
          <desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used.</desc>

          <desc>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you&#39;ll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view.</desc>

          <desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</desc>

          <desc>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:&#xA;&#xA;Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.&#xA;Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.&#xA;Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

          <name>Super Cobra</name>
          <desc>Super Cobra (スーパーコブラ Sūpā Kobura?) is a 1981 arcade game, the sequel to popular horizontally scrolling shooter Scramble, Super Cobra was developed by Konami and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America. It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.&#xA;&#xA;The game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern&#39;s third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.[1]&#xA;&#xA;Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.&#xA;&#xA;The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.&#xA;&#xA;The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO&#39;s while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2]&#xA;&#xA;The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2]&#xA;&#xA;The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,[2]&#xA;&#xA;Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.&#xA;Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.&#xA;Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.&#xA;Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.&#xA;Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.&#xA;Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.&#xA;Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.&#xA;Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.&#xA;Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.&#xA;Firing rockets in a building maze.&#xA;Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.&#xA;There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.</desc>

You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

The computer players are challenging, and trying to line up a player under the ball&#39;s shadow can be tricky. However, two drawbacks somewhat diminish gameplay: both players must be controlled simultaneously, meaning sometimes neither player can quite reach the ball; and players can&#39;t jump to block a spike.</desc>

          <desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld is an action game with adventure elements. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms.&#xA;&#xA;The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects.  These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld.  &#xA;&#xA;Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you&#39;ll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.

          <desc>SwordQuest: EarthWorld is an action game with adventure elements. The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms.&#xA;&#xA;The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

          <desc>Welcome to FireWorld.  You may have already travelled through EarthWorld and succeeded in solving the EarthWorld puzzle.  FireWorld is the second in a series of four worlds that you must pass through on your quest for the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery.&#xA;&#xA;You enter FireWorld as a mighty warrior.  Your skill and courage will be tested with dangerous trials and obstacles.  The object of the game is to solve the puzzle.&#xA;&#xA;The FireWorld puzzle is based on the Tree of Life, with ten rooms linked together by ten rooms with doorways.  FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects.  These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld.  &#xA;&#xA;Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you&#39;ll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.  As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld.  &#xA;&#xA;To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues.  Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge.  These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle.&#xA;&#xA;You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!</desc>

          <desc>You are John Q and you want to be rich.&#xA;&#xA;In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.&#xA;&#xA;Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.&#xA;&#xA;What color he is determines who he is:&#xA;Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.&#xA;Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.&#xA;Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.&#xA;&#xA;After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</desc>

The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.&#xA;&#xA;There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</desc>

Sometimes there is a giant UFO trying to catch and kill you, so the fast speed is comming in handy, although you have to avoid the asteroids and flee from the giant UFO. &#xA;&#xA;This is one of the few non-popular Atari games amongst the universe of Atari Space-games that is really good.</desc>

The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades. There were several home versions of the original; the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were only released as part of the Game, Set and Match II compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded by fans.</desc>

You can choose to play pool (first player to 25 points wins), billiards (first player to 50 points wins), trickshot (attempt to earn points by sinking all of the balls on the table in a single shot), or trickshot practice game variations. During the game you use the joystick to control a cursor which aims the cue ball. By holding down the button you control the amount of power in a shot (the longer you hold down the button, the more power the cue ball is hit with). You may also apply some English by moving the joystick while hitting the cue ball. At the end of the game a trophy will appear on screen to indicate who the winner is!</desc>

          <desc>Video Olympics is an action game containing numerous variations of the game Pong. Two players (or one player against the computer) control paddles on the screen and attempt to prevent a bouncing ball from getting past them. In the most basic game variations, each player has a single paddle and there are no obstacles on the screen. The other game variations add paddles and obstacles, and some are loosely inspired by various sports and change the playfield around, but the goal remains the same: hit the ball past your opponents paddle into the goal to earn points.</desc>

          <desc>Wing War is a rather unique game that was only available in Europe, even though it was announced for the US market and is the only Imagic title that was not released in the US. The gameplay is a little like the classic arcade game Joust, except it&#39;s a bit more complex and involves a lot of exploration. A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies. Wing War is a very unique game, and a shame it was never released in the United States.</desc>

          <desc>Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</desc>
